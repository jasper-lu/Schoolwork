C programs tend to be very fast, but break very easily. --reason????
Variables are primitives in C, not objects.
char - 1 byte
short - 16 bit
int - 32 bits
long - 64 bits
float - 32 bits
double - 64 bits

**There are functions for strings, i.e. an array of chars, but there is no string.
An interpreter reads a program one line at a time, translates, and executes -- useful for finding mistakes as c is running/compiling. Doesn't have to wait until the compiler finishes.
A compiler reads the whole program at the same time and converts it. No need for the original "recipe" after converting.
